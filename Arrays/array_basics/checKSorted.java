    Hint
    Given an array nums, return true if the array was originally sorted in non-decreasing order, then rotated some number of positions (including zero). Otherwise, return false.

    There may be duplicates in the original array.

    Note: An array A rotated by x positions results in an array B of the same length such that B[i] == A[(i+x) % A.length] for every valid index i.


    Example 1:

    Input: nums = [3,4,5,1,2]
    Output: true
    Explanation: [1,2,3,4,5] is the original sorted array.
    You can rotate the array by x = 2 positions to begin on the element of value 3: [3,4,5,1,2].
    Example 2:

    Input: nums = [2,1,3,4]
    Output: false
    Explanation: There is no sorted array once rotated that can make nums.

    Solution : 
    for a sorted array like [1,2,3,4,5,6]
    1.traverse the arrya if(arr[i] > arr[i+1]) then it is not sorted 
    
    but the array can be rotated means : [4,5,6,1,2,3] then is can be sorted and must return true.
    how to solve? 
    
    pattern for the rotated sorted array,
        1.there can be only element which can be greater it next element , like in the example
          arr[2] > arr[3] .
        2. And the last element must must be less than or equals to first element .
            for example : [4,5,6,1,2,5] if you rotate this array it cant be sorted 
        
    Solution : 
        we maintain a counter varible to count the number of element in the array .
        1.for all cases sorted or rotated there can only be 1 element can be greater so , count++
        2.And if last element cant be greater than the firt element 
            we also count if it is greater.
        step-1: traverse the array and count the greated number , if(arr[i] > arr[i+1]) count++;
        step-2: check if(arr[0] > arr[n-1] ) count ++ ;
        step-3: if(count>1) return false; else return true;

        }
        if(arr[0] < arr[n-1]) count++;
